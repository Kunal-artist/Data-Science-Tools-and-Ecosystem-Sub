\# Email Sentiment Analysis and EDA

\# ## Project Overview

\# This notebook analyzes the "email-dataset" for sentiment analysis classification tasks. The dataset is a tab-separated .txt file containing emails labeled as `ham` or `spam`. The objectives are:

\# 1. Evaluate the dataset's usefulness for sentiment analysis.

\# 2. Identify 20+ sentiment classes for classification.

\# 3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.

\#

\# ## Dataset Description

\# - \*\*Format\*\*: Tab-separated .txt file with `label\tmessage` (e.g., `ham\tGo until jurong point, crazy...`).

\# - \*\*Labels\*\*: `ham` (non-spam) and `spam`.

\# - \*\*Sample Content\*\*:

\#   - Ham: Casual, conversational (e.g., "Ok lar... Joking wif u oni...").

\#   - Spam: Promotional, urgent (e.g., "Free entry in 2 a wkly comp...").

\#

\# ## Usefulness for Sentiment Analysis

\# The dataset is highly suitable for sentiment analysis due to:

\# - \*\*Relevance\*\*: Emails reflect real-world communication with emotional and contextual cues.

\# - \*\*Diversity\*\*: Varied language (informal ham, promotional spam) supports multiple sentiment classes.

\# - \*\*Challenges\*\*:

\#   - Potential class imbalance (fewer spam emails).

\#   - Short messages may limit context.

\#   - Informal language (e.g., "crazy") requires nuanced analysis.

\# - \*\*Conclusion\*\*: Ideal for binary (ham vs. spam) and multi-class sentiment classification (20+ classes).

\#

\# ## Setup

\# Install required libraries and download NLTK data.

\# ## Summary

\# - \*\*Total Emails\*\*: {len(data)}

\# - \*\*Ham Emails\*\*: {len(data[data['label'] == 'ham'])}

\# - \*\*Spam Emails\*\*: {len(data[data['label'] == 'spam'])}

\# - \*\*Average Message Length\*\*: {data['message\_length'].mean():.2f} characters

\# - \*\*Sentiment Classes Detected\*\*:

\# {chr(10).join([f"  - {sentiment}: {count} occurrences" for sentiment, count in sentiment\_counts.items()])}

\#

\# \*\*Findings\*\*:

\# - The dataset is well-suited for sentiment analysis due to its diverse content and labeled structure.

\# - Ham emails support casual, social, and neutral sentiments; spam emails support promotional and urgent sentiments.

\# - EDA reveals potential class imbalance and varying message lengths, which may impact model training.

\# - The 22 sentiment classes cover a wide range of email tones, enabling fine-grained classification.

\#

\# \*\*Next Steps\*\*:

\# - Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.

\# - Explore advanced NLP models (e.g., BERT) for sentiment classification.

\# - Validate sentiment classes with a larger dataset.
